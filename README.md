WARNING: This chat app is like a shy introvert - it only works on your local network! 
Don't try to use it to chat with your friend in another country... unless you both share the same WiFi router! 

Think of it as a "strictly-local" social network. Perfect for:
- Chatting with yourself (we don't judge!)
- Talking to your roommate without leaving your bed
- Pretending you're a hacker while actually just messaging localhost

Remember: What happens in 127.0.0.1, stays in 127.0.0.1 

## Tips
- Use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` to connect to a server on the same machine
- For LAN chat, use the server's local IP address
- Maximum 100 clients (but let's be honest, you probably don't have that many friends on your local network)

## Commands
- Just type and press enter to send a message
- That's it! We keep things simple here!

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute! Just remember: this app is like a cat - it prefers to stay at home.
